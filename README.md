### To recreate the Virtual Environment
1. This environment was developed with Anaconda. You'll need to install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://anaconda-installer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for your platform.
2. In a terminal, navigate to the directory where the environment.yml 
is located (likely the loop-issue-report folder).
3. Run `conda env create`; this will download all of the package dependencies
and install them in a virtual environment named loop-issue-report.  

### To use the Virtual Environment
In Bash run `source activate loop-issue-report`, or in the Anaconda Prompt
run `conda activate loop-issue-report` to start the environment.

Run `deactivate` to stop the environment.
